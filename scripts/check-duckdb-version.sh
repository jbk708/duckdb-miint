# Assert that every place this repo spells out its target DuckDB version agrees.
#
# The version is duplicated across workflows, the Dockerfile, the publish cron,
# and the Python CLI's dependency pin. Nothing kept them in sync, and they have
# drifted silently before: python/pyproject.toml sat at duckdb==1.4.4 while the
# extension targeted 1.5.4 — a pin that could not possibly work, because the CLI
# does `LOAD '<extension_path>'` and a C++ extension only loads into the exact
# DuckDB version it was built against. Nothing failed loudly, because nothing
# checked. This script is that check.
#
# `duckdb_version` in MainDistributionPipeline.yml is treated as canonical: it is
# what the distribution build actually passes to `make set_duckdb_version`, so it
# is what the shipped binaries are built against.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-duckdb-version.sh          # verify; exit 1 on any mismatch
#   ./scripts/check-duckdb-version.sh --quiet  # only print problems
#
# Exit codes: 0 = consistent, 1 = mismatch or unreadable input.
